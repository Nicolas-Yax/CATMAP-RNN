# CATMAP-RNN
CATMAP RNN implementation

To learn the framework start with the test.py file (read commentaries).

A baseline code to train can be found in main.py and a basic implementation of pca analysis of latent space is in plot_pca_activations.py.

This repository contains a standard already trained network (std-category-1).
